            An employee portal is a secure site where you can easily share and discuss information within your company or organization,
            and keep all your staff on the same page. ABC Portal is a great way to create an online portal
            for your company. You can easily customize pages with simple drag & drop, and it only takes
            a minute to invite everyone and get started! Here is an overview of just some of the features
            that can help you improve communication and work faster together.

            A feed of all activity is an effective way to get a quick overview of who's been working on what,
            and to quickly post announcements and company news, or post questions & answers. The activity stream
            in Paprys is a place where all updates come together: comments from invididual pages, content updates,
            new form submissions and status updates. You can also follow activity in certain subgroups, such as departments.

            One of the most important goals of an intranet or portal is to allow for effective knowledge sharing.
            With ABC Portal, any employee (with sufficient permissions) can contribute by adding pages to the intranet
            with simple drag & drop. Pages are very flexible and can be used to write simple documents (like a wiki or knowledge base),
            share important documents, publish forms, create dashboard or create rich internal web pages. A version history of all
            pages is available to make it easy to keep track of progress and to never loose any important information.
